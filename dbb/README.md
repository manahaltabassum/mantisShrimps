# Mantis Shrimps
### Term 2 Final Project Spring 2018
##### *Sasha F., Clive J., Yuqi W., Manahal T.*


#### **Overview**
This website is meant to act as a closet organizer. Users can upload pictures of clothing items and these items will be sorted into tops, bottoms, and shoes. Users can then view the items in their closet. Using the calendar page, outfits can be created for any particular day and the weather is able to be seen as well for the upcoming few days to help you plan your outfit. If a user does not want to associate n outfit with a certain day, they can also do that. Using d3 visualization, you can see the distribution of your closet. 

### **How to launch the site:**
1. Ensure that flask, request, and flask-dropzone have been installed.
2. Ensure that api.txt is in the data directory.
3. Type in ```python __init__.py``` in your terminal to get the site running!
